#Daily Journal
Daily Journal is a simple private journal application that allows users to register and log in order to add journal entries. Users can add, edit previous entries, and delete entries.All entries are automatically stamped with the current date. Each operation is acknowledged with a flash message upon adding, editing, and deleting entries. Since users can register to the app, authentication is apparent in order to prevent multiple users from using the same email. user have to add valid email, passwords of more than 4 words.

#Motivation
I wanted to build something that would allow to me utilize a database, including authentication, route protection, and use CRUD operations. I did use a front end framework like Angular, but express handlebars allowed me to seamless integrate the backend to the front end. I kept the design simple and easy to understand for the user.
